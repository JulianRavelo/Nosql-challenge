# Nosql-challenge
## Scope  
We were given a json file with a database of establishments in the UK that received a food hygiene rating and all sorts of information about the places.  
We had to create a MongoDB and import all the data of the json file. Then we had to modify the DB by adding an establishment, deleting information we did not want on our DB and changing the type of data in all the documents of the DB.  
Finally, we had to analyse the DB and answer several questions:
- Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
- Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
- What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
- How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
